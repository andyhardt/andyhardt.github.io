							<h2>
								Research
							</h2>
							<p>My research focuses on representation theory and algebraic combinatorics, with applications in geometry, number theory, and physics. I am particularly interested in topics such as solvable lattice models, Schubert calculus, (non)symmetric functions, and the boson-fermion correspondence. Much of my work involves studying functions that generalize Schur polynomials, including supersymmetric Schur functions, Iwahori-Whittaker functions, Schubert and Grothendieck polynomials, along with various generalizations.</p>
							<!--<p>Much of what I study are various generalizations of Schur polynomials. These fall into roughly two classes: functions from representation theory such as supersymmetric Schur functions and Iwahori-Whittaker functions, and functions from geometry such as Schubert/Grothendieck polynomials and their generalizations. There is considerable overlap between the two classes, and one of my hopes is to better understand the overlap and the connections between the various families of functions, as well as to prove identities such as Cauchy formulas and product rules.</p>
							<p>As tools to study these functions, or as objects of interest in their own right, some of my favorite mathematical obejcts are solvable lattice models, quantum groups, Hecke algebras, Heisenberg algebras</p>-->

								Interests
							</h3>
							<p>(last updated: 2021)</p>
							<h4>
								Lattice Models
							</h4>
							<p>
							Solvable lattice models originated in statistical mechanics. They are 2D rectangular lattices, with edge labels either + or -, and certain allowable configurations around each vertex. By summing over all allowable ``states'', one can use local information to compute the total energy, denoted the ``partition function'' of the model. By modifying the weights and boundary conditions, one may represent special functions such as Schur functions, Whittaker functions, and Grothendieck polynomials. One can then (sometimes) prove identities such as branching rules, (dual) Cauchy formulas, and Littlewood-Richardson rules. Lattice models for Schur functions have a close connection to representation theory through Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns.
							</p>
							<p>
							The main part of my thesis research (preprint upcoming) explores the connections between solvable lattice models and Hamiltonian operators. I gave a talk on this at the <a href="http://stanford.edu/~nap/lattice-seminar">Solvable Lattice Seminar</a> hosted virtually by Stanford University. I am always interested in expressing more (always more!) special functions as lattice models, particularly functions with geometric or representation theoretic importance. I am also exploring the connections between lattice models and Hamiltonian operators.
							</p>
							<h4>
								Reductive Groups and Hecke Algebras
							</h4>
							<p>
							Representations of reductive p-adic groups are closely tied to automorphic forms. These representations are difficult to study, and many tools have been developed. Hecke algebras corresponding to various compact open subgroups (e.g. Iwahori, maximal compact) are one of these tools: they are simpler objects whose representations correspond to representations of the p-adic group with a vector fixed by the subgroup.
							</p>
							<p>
							Finite reductive groups have many uses, a major one being as a prototype for the more complicated p-adic case. More directly, Lusztig's depth zero construction obtains an important class of p-adic representations by inducing (in some sense) from the analogous finite group. The Hecke algebra most often used here is defined relative to the Borel subgroup; the resulting algebra is a trivial deformation of the Weyl group algebra.
							</p>
							<h4>
								Reductive Monoide
							</h4>
							<p>
							Reductive monoids are the neglected cousin of reductive groups. Originally studied by Putcha and Renner, they have seen new interest stemming from the work of Braverman, Kazdhan, and Ngo in the Langlands Program. They are Zariski-closed monoids whose unit group is a reductive group. Remarkably, these are exactly the monoids which are regular as semigroups. The representation theory of reductive monoids is closely related to that of reductive groups, and the two studies inform each other. Again, Hecke algebras exist in this setting, and in the finite case the analogous correspondence between Hecke algebra representations and certain representations of the reductive monoid still holds.
							</p>
							<h4>
								Alcove Walks
							</h4>
							<p>
							I have recently become interested in alcove walks after running an REU project based on them. One can view a reduced word of an element in an affine Weyl group as a sequence of alcoves, starting at the fundamental alcove and ennding at the element. If we label each step by an element of a field, and allow ourselves to ``fold'' walks, this gives us the flexibility and power to express objects as diverse as Macdonald polynomials, affine Hecke algebras, and intersections of important number-theoretic double cosets in reductive groups.
