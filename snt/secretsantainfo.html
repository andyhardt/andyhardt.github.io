							<b>Information:</b> In short, we will give presentations on each other's work.<br><br>1) Submit slides for a 5-minute presentation about your research or a topic you're interested in<br>2) We will pseudo-randomly assign a talk to each person<br>3) When it's your turn, give a talk explaining the slides (which you will be seeing for the first time).<br>4) Hilarity ensues<br><br>Snacks will be provided. All are welcome, even those outside number theory. Please read the FAQ below, and then fill out this <a href=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14gOGIdrswKBVaBfPkFnBPia2LBAj2Kt6BhuczzidZUU">Google Form.</a> (https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14gOGIdrswKBVaBfPkFnBPia2LBAj2Kt6BhuczzidZUU)<br><br><b>Ground Rules and FAQ</b><br><i>I don't have a research topic I can submit slides for, but I would still like to participate?</i><br>No problem, please sign up anyway. We will make sure there are enough presentations for everyone. (If you have two different topics you can submit slides for, we can use them for this scenario).<br><br><i>I'm nervous, and don't want to talk in front of the whole seminar.</i><br>Yeah, it is nerve-racking to give any sort of talk, particularly something you don't know anything about. But that's part of what this is about: the whole point is that these short talks will be low-key, low-expectations, and high-fun. No one's going to judge you if you seem like you don't know anything, because that's what we'll all sound like too!<br>But of course, you're welcome to just attend to watch. And if you sign up, you're totally welcome to decline your turn when it comes up--that's totally understandable.<br><br><i>What should the slides be like?</i><br>Do pretty much what you would do if you were giving a 5-minute presentation. You don't need to spend much time to make them good, but certainly don't try to make them bad. It might be funny to make a big leap that might confuse the presenter or put a complicated equation up there, but mostly try not to be too cute, and just write a few quick slides with some relevant information.<br><br><i>How should I give my talk?</i><br>The point is to have fun, so that's what you should keep in mind. You're being put into an impossible situation, so lean into that, and maybe emphasize that the surprising conclusion you just talked about really was a surprise to you too! This may not need to be said, but do not make fun of the work you're presenting. Saying "this is boring/pointless" is not what we're going for here. Just stay humble, and trust that just like a good situation comedy, most of the lols will write themselves.<br><br><i>I have never gone to SNT, but this sounds fun! Can I watch/participate?</i><br>Absolutely! Anyone is welcome, although if we have too many people sign up, we will prioritize regular attendees of the seminar. Number theory is a broad subject, so if you're submitting a presentation, please try to connect your work to number theory if possible. And if you enjoy the event, please consider sticking around and joining the seminar next term!<br><br><i>Anything else I should know?</i><br>This is the first time we're doing anything like this, so there will undoubtedly be some growing pains. It's up to us to make it work. The best thing you can do is sign up, participate with an open mind, and think about whether there's anything we could do better next time.
