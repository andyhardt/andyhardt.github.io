	<p>Galois theory is a subtle, yet beautiful subject which characterizes solutions to polynomial equations through connections between groups and fields. It was the brainchild of a troubled teenager, &Eacutevariste Galois, grieving his father's death and his college rejection, who was repeatedly arrested for his political activism. Galois sadly died in a duel, and his work wasn't fully appreciated until many decades later, but has since become an essential part of mathematics, with connections to advanced topics in number theory, algebraic geometry, and elsewhere.</p>

		<h3>Background</h3>
		<p>Most of the necessary background for this course was covered in Math 120: Groups and Rings. Having a working knowledge of topics from that course will be invaluable in this one. All relevant material can be found in earlier sections of Dummit & Foote. We will cover/review some of the most important ideas, but here are some particularly relevant topics: 
		<ul>
		    <li>Basic concepts for groups, rings, fields, vector spaces</li>
		    <li>Group/ring homomorphisms and isomorphisms</li>
		    <li>Polynomial rings and irreducibility (Dummit & Foote chapter 9; we will cover some of this material)</li>
		</ul>
