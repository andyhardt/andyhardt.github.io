\begin{problem}{\S 5.2: 8}
Suppose that a store offers gift certificates in denominations of $25$ and $40$ dollars. Determine the possible total amounts you can form using these gift certificates. Prove your answer using strong induction.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{\S 5.2: 10}
Assume that a chocolate bar consists of $n$ squares arranged in a rectangular pattern. The entire bar, a smaller rectangular piece of the bar, can be broken along on a vertical or horizontal line separating the squares. Assuming that only one piece can be broken at a time, determine how many breaks you must successively make to break the bar into $n$ separate squares. Use strong induction to prove your answer.

How many functions are there from the set $\{1, 2, \dots, n \}$, where $n$ is a positive integer, to the set $\{ 0, 1 \}$?
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{\S 6.1: 37}
How many functions are there from the set $\{ 1, 2, \dots, n \}$, where $n$ is a positive integer, to the set $\{ 0, 1 \}$
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] that are one-to-one?
    \item[(b)] that assign $0$ to both $1$ and $n$?
    \item[(c)] that assign $1$ to exactly one of the positive integers less than $n$?

\begin{problem}{\S 6.2: 8}
Show that if $f$ is a function from $S$ to $T$, where $S$ and $T$ are finite sets with $|S| > |T|$, then there are elements $s_1$ and $s_2$ in $S$ such that $f(s_1) = f(s_2)$, or in other words, $f$ is not one-to-one.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{\S 6.2: 14}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] Show that if seven integers are selected from the first 10 positive integers, there must be at least two pairs of these integers with the sum 11.
