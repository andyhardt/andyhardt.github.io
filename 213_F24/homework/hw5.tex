\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{\S 6.3 - 42}
Find a formula for the number of ways to seat $r$ of $n$ people around a circular table, where seatings are considered the same if every person has the same two neighbors without regard to which side these neighbors are sitting on.
\end{problem}

\begin{problem}{\S 6.4 - 10}
Give a formula for the coefficient of $x^k$ in the expansion of $(x+1/x)^{100}$, where $k$ is an integer.

\begin{problem}{\S 6.4 - 12}
The row of Pascal's triangle containing the binomia coefficients ${ 10 \choose k}$, for $0 \leq k \leq 10$, is:
\[1~~10~~45~~120~~210~~252~~210~~120~~45~~10~~1 \]

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] using a combinatorial argument.
    \item[(b)] using an argument based on the formula for the number of $r$-combinations of a set with $n$ elements.
\end{enumerate}
\end{problem}
