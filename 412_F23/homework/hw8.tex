\textbf{Due:} Wednesday, November 8th, at 9:00AM via Gradescope

\textbf{Instructions:} Students taking the course for three credit hours (undergraduates, most graduate
students) should choose four of the following five problems to solve and turn in--if you do all five, only the first four will be graded. Graduate students
taking the course for four credits should solve all five. Problems that use the word ``describe”,
``determine”, ``show", or ``prove" require proof for all claims.

\begin{enumerate}

\item[1.] Let $G$ be a $2$-connected simple graph.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] Prove that in every ear decomposition of $G$, the number of ears (including the initial cycle) is $|E(G)|-|V(G)|+1$.
    
\item[(b)] Let $s,t\in E(G)$. Prove that the vertices of $G$ can be linearly ordered so that each vertex apart from $s$ and $t$ has a neighbor that is earlier in the order and a neighbor that is later in the order.
 
\end{enumerate}

\item[2.] Let $G$ be a connected graph with at least 3 vertices. Prove that the following are equivalent:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(A)] $G$ is 2-edge connected
    \item[(B)] Every edge of $G$ appears in a cycle
    \item[(C)] Every pair of edges of $G$ lie on a closed trail
    \item[(D)] Every pair of vertices of $G$ lie on a closed trail
\end{enumerate}

\item[3.] Use Menger's Theorem to prove that $\kappa(G)=\kappa'(G)$ when $G$ is 3-regular (Theorem~4.1.11).

\item[4.] Find a minimum capacity source-to-sink edge cut in the following network (make sure to also prove it is indeed of minimum capacity):

\end{center}

\item[5.] Let $B$ be an $X,Y$-bigraph that satisfies Hall's condition for $X$ (i.e. $|N(S)|\geq S$ for all $S\subseteq X$). WITHOUT USING HALL'S THEOREM, and instead using network flow, prove that there is a matching that saturates $X$.

\emph{[Hint: Create a digraph with consists of an orientation of $B$, along with a source and sink. Choose capacities so that a minimum cut won't contain any edges of $B$, and use the max-flow, min-cut theorem.]}

\end{enumerate}
